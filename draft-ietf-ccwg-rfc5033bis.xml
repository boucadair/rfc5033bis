<?line 85?>

<t>Introducing new or modified congestion control algorithms in the global Internet has
possible ramifications to both the flows using the proposed congestion control algorithms
and to flows using a standardized congestion control algorithm. Therefore, the IETF
must proceed with caution when evaluating proposals for alternate congestion control.
The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering standardization
of a proposed congestion control algorithm at the IETF. It replaces RFC5033 to reflect
changes in the congestion control landscape.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>This document provides guidelines for the IETF to use when evaluating
a proposed congestion control algorithm that differ
from the general congestion control principles outlined in <xref target="RFC2914"/>.
The guidance is intended to be useful to authors proposing
congestion control algorithms and for the IETF community when evaluating whether
a proposal is appropriate for publication in the RFC series and for
deployment in the Internet.</t>

<t>This document obsoletes the similarly titled <xref target="RFC5033"/> that was
published in 2007 as a Best Current Practice to evaluate proposed
congestion control algorithms as Experimental or Proposed Standard RFCs.</t>

<t>The IETF's standard congestion control algorithms have been shown to have
performance challenges in various environments
(e.g., high-speed networks, cellular and WiFi wireless technologies,
long distance satellite links)
and also flows carrrying specific workloads (VoIP, gaming, and videoconferencing).</t>

<t>In 2007, TCP was the dominant consumer of this work, and proposals for changes
to the congestion control algorithms
were typically discussed in the Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG).
SCTP <xref target="RFC9260"/> followed the congestion control algorithms specified for TCP.
DCCP <xref target="RFC4340"/>, provided support for congestion control algorithms
similar to TCP, but also other congestion control algorithms.</t>

<t>Since RFC 5033 was published, many conditions have changed.
The set of protocols using these algorithms has spread beyond
TCP, SCTP and DCCP. This set now includes QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/>,
RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT) and probably more.</t>

<t>Some proponents of alternative congestion control algorithms now have the opportunity
to test and deploy at scale without IETF review.
There is more interest in specialized use cases, such as data centers, and in
support for a variety of upper layer protocols/applications, e.g.,
real-time protocols.
Finally, the community has gained much more experience with indications
of congestion beyond packet loss.</t>

<t>Multicast congestion control is a considerably less mature field of study
and are not in scope for this document.
However, Section 4 of the UDP Usage Guidelines <xref target="RFC8085"/> provides
additional guidelines for multicast and broadcast usage of UDP.</t>

<t>Congestion control algorithms
have been developed outside of the IETF, including at least two that saw
large scale deployment: Cubic <xref target="HRX08"/>
and Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR) <xref target="BBR-draft"/>.</t>

<t>Cubic was documented in a research publication in 2007 <xref target="HRX08"/>,
and was then adopted as the default congestion control algorithm for
the TCP implementation in Linux. It was already used in a significant
fraction of TCP connections over the Internet before being documented
in an Informational Internet Draft in 2015, published as an
Informational RFC in 2017 <xref target="RFC8312"/> and then as a Proposed
Standard in 2023 <xref target="RFC9438"/>.</t>

<t>BBR is developed as an internal research project by Google,
with the first implementation contributed to Linux kernel 4.19 in 2016.
It was described in an IRTF draft in 2018, and that draft is
regularly updated to document the evolving versions of the algorithm
<xref target="BBR-draft"/>. BBR is widely used for Google services using either
TCP or QUIC, and is also widely deployed outside of
Google.</t>

<t>We cannot say now whether the original authors of <xref target="RFC5033"/>
expected that developers would be somehow waiting for IETF review
before widely deploying a new congestion control algorithm over the
Internet, but the examples of Cubic and BBR teach us that
deployment of new algorithms is not in fact gated by publication
of the algorithm as an RFC.</t>

<t>Nevertheless, specifying congestion control algorithms has a number of advantages:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A specification can help implementers, operators, and other interested
parties to develop a shared understanding of how the algorithm works and how
it is expected to behave in various different scenarios or configurations.</t>
  <t>A specification can help potential contributors understand the algorithm,
which can make it easier for them to suggest improvements and/or identify
limitations. Further, the specification can help multiple contributors align
on a consensus change to the algorithm.</t>
  <t>A specification that is accessible to anyone circumvents the issue that some
implementors may be unable to read open source reference implementations due
to the constraints of some open source licenses.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Beyond helping develop specific algorithm proposals, guidelines can also serve
as a reminder to potential inventors and developers of the multiple facets of
the congestion control problem.</t>

<t>The evaluation guidelines in this document are intended to be consistent with
the congestion control principles from <xref target="RFC2914"/> of preventing
congestion collapse, considering fairness, and optimizing a flow's
own performance in terms of throughput, delay, and loss.
<xref target="RFC2914"/>
also discusses the goal of avoiding a congestion control "arms race"
among competing transport protocols.</t>

<t>This document does not give hard-and-fast requirements for an
appropriate congestion control algorithm.
Rather, the document provides
a set of criteria that should be considered and weighed by the
developers of alternative algorithms and by the IETF
in the context of each proposal.</t>

<t>The high-order criterion for advancing any proposal
is a serious scientific study of the pros and cons of
the congestion control algorithm that is brought to the IETF and
considered for publication by the IETF.</t>

<t>After initial studies, we encourage authors to write a specification
of their proposal for publication in the RFC series. This allows others
to concretely understand and investigate the wealth of proposals in
this space.</t>

<t>This document is meant to reduce the barriers to entry for new congestion
control work to the IETF. As such, proponents ought not to interpret these criteria as a
checklist of requirements before approaching the IETF. Instead, proponents
are encouraged to think about these issues beforehand, and have the willingness
to do the work implied by the remainder of this document.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="document-status"><name>Document Status</name>

<t>This document applies to proposed congestion control algorithms that seek Experimental or
Standards Track status. Evaluation of both cases involves the same questions,
but with different expectations for both the answers and the degree of
certainty of the answers.</t>

<t>Congestion control algorithms without experience of Internet-scale deployment SHOULD
seek Experimental status until real-world data is able to answer the questions
in <xref target="general-use"/>. Congestion control algorithms with a record of measured
Internet-scale deployment MAY directly seek the Standards Track if the community believes
it is safe, and the design is stable, guided by the considerations in
<xref target="general-use"/>. The existence of this data does not waive the other
considerations in this document.</t>

<t>Algorithms that are designed for special environments (e.g., data centers) and
forbidden from use in the Internet would, of course, instead seek real-world
data for those environments.</t>

<t>Experimental specifications SHOULD NOT be deployed as a default and SHOULD
only be deployed in situations where they are being actively measured, and where
it is possible to deactivate if there are signs of pathological behavior.</t>

<t>Each published congestion control algorithm is REQUIRED to include a
statement in the abstract indicating whether or not there is IETF consensus that
the proposed congestion control algorithm is considered safe for use on the Internet.
Each published algorithm
is also required to include a statement in the
abstract describing environments where the protocol is not recommended
for deployment. There can be environments where the congestion control
algorith is deemed <em>safe</em>
for use, but it is still is not <em>recommended</em> for use because it does not
perform well for the user.</t>

<t>As examples of such statements, <xref target="RFC3649"/> specifying HighSpeed TCP
includes a statement in the abstract stating that the proposed congestion control algorithm is
Experimental, but may be deployed in the current Internet. In
contrast, the Quick-Start document <xref target="RFC4782"/> includes a paragraph in
the abstract stating the mechanism is only being proposed for
use in controlled environments.  The abstract specifies environments where
the Quick-Start request could give false positives (and therefore
would be unsafe for incremental deployment where some routers
forward, but do not process the option). The abstract also specifies environments
where packets containing the Quick-Start request could be dropped in
the network; in such an environment, Quick-Start would not be unsafe
to deploy, but deployment would not be recommended because it
could lead to unnecessary delays for the connections attempting to use
Quick-Start. The Quick-Start method is discussed as an example in <xref target="RFC9049"/>.</t>

<t>Alhough out of the scope of this document, a proponent of a new
algorithm could alternatively
seek publication as an Informational or Experimental RFC via the Internet
Research Task Force (IRTF).
In general, these algorithms are expected to be less
mature than ones that follow the procedures in this document. Authors documenting
deployed congestion control algorithms that cannot be changed by IETF or IRTF review
are invited to publish as an Informational RFC via the Independent Stream Editor
(ISE).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="evaluation-criteria"><name>Evaluation Criteria</name>

<t>As noted above, authors are expected to do a well-rounded evaluation
of the pros and cons of congestion control algorithms that are brought to the IETF.
The following guidelines are designed to help authors and the IETF community. Concerns that
fall outside the scope of these guidelines are certainly possible;
these guidelines should not be considered as an all-encompassing
check-list.</t>

<t>When considering a proposed congestion control algorithm, the community MUST
consider the following criteria. These criteria will be evaluated in various
domains (see <xref target="general-use"/> and <xref target="special-cases"/>).</t>

<section anchor="single-algorithm-behavior"><name>Single Algorithm Behavior</name>

<t>The criteria in this section evaluate the congestion control algorithm when one or more flows
using that algorithm share a bottleneck link (i.e. with no flows
using a differing congestion control algorithm).</t>

<section anchor="protection-against-congestion-collapse"><name>Protection Against Congestion Collapse</name>

<t>A congestion control algorithm should either stop
sending when the packet drop rate exceeds some threshold
<xref target="RFC3714"/>, or should include some notion of "full backoff". For
"full backoff", at some point the algorithm would reduce the
sending rate to one packet per round-trip time and then
exponentially backoff the time between single packet
transmissions if the congestion persists.  Exactly when either "full
backoff" or a pause in sending comes into play will be
algorithm-specific.  However, as discussed in <xref target="RFC2914"/> and <xref target="RFC8961"/>, this
requirement is crucial to protect the network in times of extreme (persistent)
congestion.</t>

<t>If the result of full backoff is used, this test does not require that the
full backoff mechanism must be identical to that of TCP
<xref target="RFC2988"/> <xref target="RFC8961"/>.  As an example, this does not preclude full
backoff mechanisms that would give flows with different round-trip
times comparable capacity during backoff.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="protection-against-bufferbloat"><name>Protection Against Bufferbloat</name>

<t>A congestion control algorithm should reduce its sending
rate if the round trip time (RTT) significantly increases. Exactly how
the algorithm reduces its sending rate is algorithm-specific, but see
<xref target="RFC8961"/> and <xref target="RFC8085"/> for requirements.</t>

<t>Bufferbloat <xref target="Bufferbloat"/> refers to the building of long queues in
the network. Many network routers are configured with very large buffers.
If congestion is detected, classic TCP congestion control algorithms
<xref target="RFC5681"/> will continue sending at a high rate until a First-In First-Out
(FIFO) buffer completely fills and packet losses then occur. Every connection pasing through
that bottleneck will then experience increased latency.  This adds unwanted latency that
impacts highly interactive applications like games, but it also affects routine
web browsing and video playing.</t>

<t>This problem became apparent in the last decade and was not discussed in
the Congestion Control Principles published in September 2002 <xref target="RFC2914"/>.
The classic congestion control algorithm <xref target="RFC5681"/> and the widely deployed
Cubic algorithm <xref target="RFC9438"/> do not address it, but a new
congestion control algorithm has the opportunity to improve the state of the art.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="fairness-within-the-proposed-congestion-control-algorithm"><name>Fairness within the Proposed Congestion Control Algorithm</name>

<t>When multiple competing flows all use the same
proposed congestion control algorithm, the proposal should
explore how the capacity is shared among the competing flows.
Capacity fairness can be important when a small number of similar
flows compete to fill a bottleneck. It can however also not be useful,
for example, when comparing flows that seek to send at different rates or
when some of the flows do not last sufficiently long to approach
asymptotic behavior.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="short-flows"><name>Short Flows</name>

<t>A great deal of congestion control analysis concerns the steady-state behavior
of long flows. However, many Internet flows are relatively short-lived. If flows
never experience a packet loss, a short-lived flow remains in the "slow start" mode of
operation <xref target="RFC5681"/> that commonly features exponential congestion window growth.</t>

<t>A proposed congestion control algorithm MUST consider how new and short-lived flows affect long-lived flows,
and vice versa.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="mixed-algorithm-behavior"><name>Mixed Algorithm Behavior</name>

<t>These criteria evaluate the interaction of the
proposed congestion control algorithm with commonly deployed
congestion control algorithms.</t>

<t>In contexts where differing congestion control
algorithms are used, it is important to understand whether
the proposed congestion control algorithm could result in more
harm than previously defined algorithms to flows sharing a common bottleneck.
The measure of harm is not restricted to the equality
of capacity, but ought also to consider metrics such as the
introduced latency, or an increase in packet loss. An evaluation must
assess the potential to cause starvation, including assurance that
a loss of all feedback (e.g., detected by expiry of a retransmission time out)
results in backoff.</t>

<section anchor="existing-general-purpose-transports"><name>Existing General-Purpose Transports</name>

<t>A proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD be evaluated when
competing using standard IETF congestion controls, e.g. <xref target="RFC5681"/>,
<xref target="RFC9002"/>, <xref target="RFC9438"/>.
A proposed congestion control algorithm
that has a significantly negative impact on
flows using standard congestion control might be suspect and this aspect should
be part of the community's decision making with regards to the suitability of
the proposed congestion control algorithm. The community should also consider
other non-standard congestion control algorithms that are known to be widely deployed.</t>

<t>We note that this guideline is not a requirement for strict Reno- or Cubic-
friendliness as a prerequisite for a proposed congestion
control mechanism to advance to Experimental or Standards Track status.
As an example,
HighSpeed TCP is a congestion control mechanism specified as
Experimental, that is not TCP-friendly in all environments.
When a new congestion control algorithm is deployed, the existing major deployments need to be
considered to avoid severe performance degradation.
We also note that this guideline does not constrain the interaction with
non-best-effort flows.</t>

<t>As an example from an Experimental RFC, fairness with standard TCP is discussed
in Sections 4 and 6 of <xref target="RFC3649"/> (HighSpeed TCP) and using spare capacity is
discussed in Sections 6, 11.1, and 12 of <xref target="RFC3649"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="real-time-protocols"><name>Real-Time Protocols</name>

<t>General-purpose protocols need to coexist in the Internet with real-time congestion
control algorithms, which, in general, have finite throughput requirements (i.e.
do not seek to utilize all available capacity) and more strict latency
bounds.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8868"/> provides suggestions for real-time congestion control design and
<xref target="RFC8867"/> suggests test cases. <xref target="RFC9392"/> describes some considerations
for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). In particular, feedback for real-time
flows can be less frequent than the acknowledgements provided by reliable
transports. This document does not change the informational status of those
RFCs.</t>

<t>A proposed congestion control algorithms SHOULD consider coexistence with widely deployed real-time
congestion control algorithms. Regrettably, at the time of writing, many algorithms with
detailed public specifications are not widely deployed, while many widely
deployed real-time congestion control algorithms have incomplete public specifications.
It is hoped this situation will change.</t>

<t>To the extent that behavior of widely deployed algorithms is understood,
a proposed congestion control algorithm
can analyze and simulate their interaction with those algorithms. To the
extent they are not, experiments can be conducted where possible.</t>

<t>Note that in many deployments, real-time flows are directed into distinct
queues via Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCP) or other mechanisms,
which substantially reduces the interplay with other traffic. However, a proposal
targeting general Internet use</t>

</section>
<section anchor="short-and-long-flows"><name>Short and Long Flows</name>

<t>The effect on short-lived and long-lived flows using other common congestion
control algorithms MUST be evaluated, as in <xref target="short-flows"/>.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="other-criteria"><name>Other Criteria</name>

<section anchor="differences-with-congestion-control-principles"><name>Differences with Congestion Control Principles</name>

<t>Proposed congestion control algorithms SHOULD include a clear
explanation of any deviations from <xref target="RFC2914"/> and <xref target="RFC7141"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="incremental-deployment"><name>Incremental Deployment</name>

<t>The proposed congestion control algorithm ought to discuss whether it
allows for incremental deployment in the
targeted environment.  For a mechanism targeted for deployment in
the current Internet, it would be helpful for the proposal to
discuss what is known (if anything) about the correct operation
of the mechanisms with some of the equipment that can be installed in the
current Internet, e.g., routers, transparent proxies, WAN
optimizers, intrusion detection systems, home routers, and the
like.</t>

<t>As a similar concern, if the proposed congestion control algorithm
is intended only for specific environments (and not the
global Internet), the proposal should consider how this intention
is to be realised.  The community will have to address the
question of whether the scope can be enforced by stating
the restrictions or whether additional protocol mechanisms are
required to enforce this scoping.  The answer will necessarily
depend on the change that is being proposed.</t>

<t>As an example from an Experimental RFC, deployment issues are
discussed in Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of <xref target="RFC4782"/> (Quick-Start).</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="general-use"><name>General Use</name>

<t>The criteria in <xref target="evaluation-criteria"/> will be evaluated in the
following scenarios.
Unless a proposed congestion control algorithm
explicitly forbids use on the
public Internet, the community MUST find that it meets the criteria
in these scenarios for the proposed congestion control algorithm to progress.</t>

<t>The evaluation in each scenario should occur over a representative range of
bandwidths, delays, and queue depths. Of course, the set of parameters
representative of the public Internet will change over time.</t>

<t>These criteria are intended to capture a statistically dominant set of Internet
conditions. In the case that a proposed congestion control algorithm
has been tested at Internet scale,
the results from that deployment are often useful for answering these questions.</t>

<section anchor="paths-with-tail-drop-queues"><name>Paths with Tail-drop Queues</name>

<t>The performance of a congestion control algorithm is affected by the queue discipline applied at
the bottleneck link. The drop-tail queue discipline (using a FIFO buffer) MUST be evaluated.
See <xref target="aqm"/> for evaluation of other queue
disciplines.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="tunnel-behavior"><name>Tunnel Behavior</name>

<t>When a proposed congestion control algorithm relies on explicit signals from the path, the proposal
MUST consider the effect of
flow passing through a tunnel, where routers may not be aware of the
flow.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="wired-paths"><name>Wired Paths</name>

<t>Wired networks are usually characterized by extremely low rates of packet loss except
for those due to queue drops. They tend to have stable aggregate bandwidth,
usually higher than other types of links, and low non-queueing delay. Because
the properties are relatively simple, wired links are typically used as a
"baseline" case even if they are not always the bottleneck link in the modern
Internet.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="wireless-paths"><name>Wireless Paths</name>

<t>While the early Internet was dominated by wired links, the properties
of wireless links have become extremely important to Internet performance.
In particular, a proposed congestion control algorithm should be evaluated in situations
where some packet losses are due to radio effects, rather than router
queue drops; the link capacity varies over time due to changing link conditions;
and media access delays and link-layer retransmission lead to increased jitter
in round-trip times. See <xref target="RFC3819"/> and Section 16 of <xref target="Tools"/> for further
discussion of wireless properties.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="special-cases"><name>Special Cases</name>

<t>The criteria in <xref target="evaluation-criteria"/> will be evaluated in the
following scenarios, unless the proposed congestion control
algorithm specifically excludes its use in a
scenario. For these specific use-cases, the community
MAY allow a proposal to progress even if the criteria
indicate an unsatisfactory result for these scenarios.</t>

<t>In general, measurements from Internet-scale deployments might not expose the
properties of operation in each of these scenarios, because they are not as
ubiquitous as the General Use scenarios.</t>

<section anchor="aqm"><name>Active Queue Management (AQM)</name>

<t>The proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD be evaluated under a variety of bottleneck queue disciplines.
The effect of an AQM discipline can be hard to detect by Internet evaluation.
At a minimum, a proposal should reason about an algorithm's response to various
AQM disciplines. Simulation or empirical results are, of course, valuable.</t>

<t>Among the AQM techniques that might have an impact on a proposed congestion control
algorithm are FQ-CoDel <xref target="RFC8290"/>; Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced
(PIE) <xref target="RFC8033"/>; and Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S)
<xref target="RFC9332"/>.</t>

<t>A proposed congestion control algorithm that sets one of the two Explicit Congestion Transport (ECT)
codepoints in the IP header can gain the benefits of receiving Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
Congestion Experienced (CE) signals from an on-path AQM <xref target="RFC8087"/>.
Use of ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/>,<xref target="RFC9332"/> results in requirements for
the congestion control algorithm to react when it receives a packet with an ECN-CE marking.
This reaction needs to be evaluated to confirm that the algorithm conforms with the
requirements of the ECT codepoint that was used.</t>

<t>Note that evaluation of AQM techniques -- as opposed to their impact on a specific
proposed congestion control algorithm -- is out of scope of this document. <xref target="RFC7567"/>
describes design considerations for AQMs.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="delay"><name>Paths with Varying Delay</name>

<t>An Internet Path can include simple links, where the minimum delay is the propagation delay,
and any additional delay can be attributed to link buffering. This cannot be assumed.
An Internet Path can also include complex subnetworks where the minimum delay changes over
various time scales, resulting in a non-stationary minimum delay.</t>

<t>This occurs when a subnet changes the forwarding path to optimise capacity, resilience, etc.
It could also arise when a subnet uses a capacity management method where the available
resource is periodically distributed among the active nodes and where a node might then
have to buffer data until an assigned transmission opportunity or when the physical path
changes (e.g., when the length of a wireless path changes, or the physical layer changes
its mode of operation).
Variation also arises when a higher priority diffserv traffic classic prompts the
transmission by a lower class. In these cases, the delay varies as a function of
external factors and attempting to infer congestion from an increase in the delay
results in reduced throughput. The jitter from variation over short timescales
might not be distinguishable similar from other effects.</t>

<t>A proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD be evaluated to ensure their operation is robust
when there is a significant change in the minimum delay.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="internet-of-things"><name>Internet of Things</name>

<t>The "Internet of Things" (IoT) is a broad concept, but when evaluating
a proposed congestion control algorithm,
it is often associated with unique characteristics.</t>

<t>IoT nodes might be more constrained in power, CPU, or other parameters than
conventional Internet hosts. This might place limits on the complexity of any
given algorithm. These power and radio constraints might make the volume of
control packets in a given algorithm a key evaluation metric.</t>

<t>Furthermore, many IoT applications do not a have a human in the loop, and
therefore can have weaker latency constraints because they do not relate to a user
experience, but still need to share the path with other flows with different
constraints.</t>

<t>Extremely low-power links can lead to very low throughput and a low bandwidth-
delay product, well below the standard operating range of most Internet flows.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="paths-with-high-delay"><name>Paths with High Delay</name>

<t>A proposed congestion control algorithm ought not to presume that all general Internet paths have a low
delay.
Some paths include links that contibute much more delay than for a typical Internet path.
Satellite links often have delays longer than typical for wired paths
<xref target="RFC2488"/> and high delay bandwidth products <xref target="RFC3649"/>.
Also, many systems
use dynamic capacity assignment that can result in variation of the delay
and the capacity over timescales of the order of the path RTT.
Robustness to delay and delay variation may be a key evaluation metric.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="misbehaving-nodes"><name>Misbehaving Nodes</name>

<t>A proposed congestion control algorithm should explore
how the algorithm performs with non-compliant senders, receivers, or
routers.  In addition, the proposal should explore how a
proposed congestion control algorithm performs with outside
attackers.  This can be particularly important for proposed congestion control algorithms
that involve explicit feedback from routers
along the path.</t>

<t>As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance with
misbehaving nodes and outside attackers is discussed in Sections
9.4, 9.5, and 9.6 of <xref target="RFC4782"/> (Quick-Start).  This includes
discussion of misbehaving senders and receivers; collusion
between misbehaving routers; misbehaving middleboxes; and the
potential use of Quick-Start to attack routers or to tie up
available Quick-Start bandwidth.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extreme-packet-reordering"><name>Extreme Packet Reordering</name>

<t>A proposed congestion control algorithm ought not to presume that all general
Internet paths reliably deliver
packets in order. <xref target="RFC4653"/> discusses the effect of extreme packet reordering.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="transient-events"><name>Transient Events</name>

<t>A proposed congestion control algorithm SHOULD
consider how the proposed congestion control
algorithm would perform in the presence of transient events such
as sudden onset of congestion, a routing change, or a mobility event.
Routing changes, link disconnections, intermittent link

<section anchor="sudden-changes-in-the-path"><name>Sudden changes in the Path</name>

<t>An IETF transport is not tied to a specific Internet path or type of path.
The set of routers that form a path can and do change with time,
this will cause the properties of the path to change with respect to time.
A proposed congestion control algorithm
MUST evaluate the impact of changes in the path, and be robust
to changes in path characteristics on the interval of common Internet re-routing intervals.</t>

<t>Even when the set of routers constituting a path does not change, the properties of
that path can vary with time (e.g., due to a change of link capacity,
relative priority, or a change
in the rate of other flows sharing a bottleneck), with a potential impact on the
operation of a congestion control algorithm.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="multipath-transport"><name>Multipath Transport</name>

<t>Multipath transport protocols permit more than one path to be differentiated and used by
a single connection at the sender.
A multipath sender can schedule which packets travel on which of its active paths.
This enables a tradeoff in timeliness and reliability. There are various ways that
multipath techniques can be used.</t>

<t>One example use is to provide fail-over from one path to
another when the original path is no longer viable or to switch the traffic from
one path to another when this is expected to improve performance
(latency, throughput, reliability, cost).
Designs need to independently track the congestion state of each path,
and need to demonstrate independent congestion control for each path being used.
A proposed multipath congestion control algorithm that
implements path fail-over MUST evaluate the harm resulting
from a change in the path, and show that this does not result in flow starvation.
Synchronisation of failover (e.g., where multiple flows change their path on similar
timeframes) can also contribute to harm and/or reduce fairness,
these effects also ought to be evaluated.</t>

<t>Another example use is concurrent multipath, where the transport protocol simultaneously
schedules flows to aggregate the capacity across multiple paths.
The Internet provides no guarantee that different paths
(e.g., using different endpoint addresses) are disjoint.
This has additional implications:
A proposed congestion control algorithm MUST evaluate the potential
harm to other flows when the multiple paths share a common
congested bottleneck
(or share resources that are coupled between different paths,
such as an overall capacity limit), and SHOULD consider
the potential for harm to other flows. Synchronisation of congestion control mechanisms
(e.g., where multiple flows change their behaviour on similar
timeframes) can also contribute to harm and/or reduce fairness,
these effects also ought to be evaluated.
At the time of writing, there are no IETF standards for concurrent
multipath congestion control in the general Internet.</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>This document does not represent a change to any aspect of the TCP/IP
protocol suite and therefore does not directly impact Internet
security.  The implementation of various facets of the Internet's
current congestion control algorithms do have security implications
(e.g., as outlined in <xref target="RFC5681"/>).</t>

<t>The IETF process that results in publication needs to
ensure that these security implications are considered.
Proposed congestion control algorithms therefore ought to be mindful of pitfalls, and should
examine any potential security issues that may arise.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of congestion along a network path). While many mechanisms have been designed to detect loss, ultimately, protocols can only count on the passage of time without delivery confirmation to declare a packet "lost". Each implementation of a time-based loss detection mechanism represents a balance between correctness and timeliness; therefore, no implementation suits all situations. This document provides high-level requirements for time-based loss detectors appropriate for general use in unicast communication across the Internet. Within the requirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars that best address each situation.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports.</t>
      <t>Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</t>
      <t>Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm.  BBR
   (&quot;Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time&quot;) uses recent
   measurements of a transport connection&#x27;s delivery rate, round-trip
   time, and packet loss rate to build an explicit model of the network
   path.  BBR then uses this model to control both how fast it sends
   data and the maximum volume of data it allows in flight in the
   network at any time.  Relative to loss-based congestion control
   algorithms such as Reno [RFC5681] or CUBIC [RFC8312], BBR offers
   substantially higher throughput for bottlenecks with shallow buffers
   or random losses, and substantially lower queueing delays for
   bottlenecks with deep buffers (avoiding &quot;bufferbloat&quot;).  BBR can be
   implemented in any transport protocol that supports packet-delivery
   acknowledgment.  Thus far, open source implementations are available
   for TCP [RFC793] and QUIC [RFC9000].  This document specifies version
   2 of the BBR algorithm, also sometimes referred to as BBRv2 or bbr2.

    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks). Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles. Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion control. Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals. The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.

    <abstract>
      <t>The proposals in this document are experimental. While they may be deployed in the current Internet, they do not represent a consensus that this is the best method for high-speed congestion control. In particular, we note that alternative experimental proposals are likely to be forthcoming, and it is not well understood how the proposals in this document will interact with such alternative proposals. This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments. For example, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets (or equivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours). This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint. To address his limitation of TCP, this document proposes HighSpeed TCP, and solicits experimentation and feedback from the wider community.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an optional Quick-Start mechanism for transport protocols, in cooperation with routers, to determine an allowed sending rate at the start and, at times, in the middle of a data transfer (e.g., after an idle period). While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request.</t>
      <t>This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

      <t>This document discusses IAB concerns about effective end-to-end congestion control for best-effort voice traffic in the Internet. These concerns have to do with fairness, user quality, and with the dangers of congestion collapse. The concerns are particularly relevant in light of the absence of a widespread Quality of Service (QoS) deployment in the Internet, and the likelihood that this situation will not change much in the near term. This document is not making any recommendations about deployment paths for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in terms of QoS support, and is not claiming that best-effort service can be relied upon to give acceptable performance for VoIP. We are merely observing that voice traffic is occasionally deployed as best-effort traffic over some links in the Internet, that we expect this occasional deployment to continue, and that we have concerns about the lack of effective end-to-end congestion control for this best-effort voice traffic. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>

      <t>FQ-CoDel mixes packets from multiple flows and reduces the impact of head-of-line blocking from bursty traffic. It provides isolation for low-rate traffic such as DNS, web, and videoconferencing traffic. It improves utilisation across the networking fabric, especially for bidirectional traffic, by keeping queue lengths short, and it can be implemented in a memory- and CPU-efficient fashion across a wide range of hardware.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation. As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance. There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.</t>
      <t>This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations. The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines a framework for coupling the Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms in two queues intended for flows with different responses to congestion. This provides a way for the Internet to transition from the scaling problems of standard TCP-Reno-friendly ('Classic') congestion controls to the family of 'Scalable' congestion controls. These are designed for consistently very low queuing latency, very low congestion loss, and scaling of per-flow throughput by using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in a modified way. Until the Coupled Dual Queue (DualQ), these Scalable L4S congestion controls could only be deployed where a clean-slate environment could be arranged, such as in private data centres.</t>
      <t>This specification first explains how a Coupled DualQ works. It then gives the normative requirements that are necessary for it to work well. All this is independent of which two AQMs are used, but pseudocode examples of specific AQMs are given in appendices.</t>

      <t>The goal of this document is to describe the potential benefits of applications using a transport that enables Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). The document outlines the principal gains in terms of increased throughput, reduced delay, and other benefits when ECN is used over a network path that includes equipment that supports Congestion Experienced (CE) marking. It also discusses challenges for successful deployment of ECN. It does not propose new algorithms to use ECN nor does it describe the details of implementation of ECN in endpoint devices (Internet hosts), routers, or other network devices.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies Non-Congestion Robustness (NCR) for TCP. In the absence of explicit congestion notification from the network, TCP uses loss as an indication of congestion. One of the ways TCP detects loss is using the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments. However, this heuristic is not always correct, notably in the case when network paths reorder segments (for whatever reason), resulting in degraded performance. TCP-NCR is designed to mitigate this degraded performance by increasing the number of duplicate acknowledgments required to trigger loss recovery, based on the current state of the connection, in an effort to better disambiguate true segment loss from segment reordering. This document specifies the changes to TCP, as well as the costs and benefits of these modifications. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

    <title>Metrics for the Evaluation of Congestion Control Mechanisms</title>
    <author fullname="S. Floyd" initials="S." role="editor" surname="Floyd"/>
    <date month="March" year="2008"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the metrics to be considered in an evaluation of new or modified congestion control mechanisms for the Internet. These include metrics for the evaluation of new transport protocols, of proposed modifications to TCP, of application-level congestion control, and of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms in the router. This document is the first in a series of documents aimed at improving the models that we use in the evaluation of transport protocols.</t>
      <t>This document is a product of the Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG), and has received detailed feedback from many members of the Research Group (RG). As the document tries to make clear, there is not necessarily a consensus within the research community (or the IETF community, the vendor community, the operations community, or any other community) about the metrics that congestion control mechanisms should be designed to optimize, in terms of trade-offs between throughput and delay, fairness between competing flows, and the like. However, we believe that there is a clear consensus that congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated in terms of trade-offs between a range of metrics, rather than in terms of optimizing for a single metric. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
