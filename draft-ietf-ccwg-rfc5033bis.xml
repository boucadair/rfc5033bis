<?line 86?>

<t>The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown
to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks,
wireless technologies such as 3GPP and WiFi, long distance satellite
links) and also in conflict with the needed, more isochronous,
behaviors of VoIP, gaming, and videoconferencing traffic.
Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion
control schemes that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion
control principles.
Using these new congestion control schemes in
the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the traffic
using the new congestion control and to traffic using the currently
standardized congestion control.
Therefore, the IETF must proceed
with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control
proposals.
The goal of this document is to provide guidance for
considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>This document provides guidelines for the IETF to use when evaluating
suggested congestion control algorithms that significantly differ
from the general congestion control principles outlined in <xref target="RFC2914"/>.
The guidance is intended to be useful to authors proposing alternate
congestion control and for the IETF community when evaluating whether
a proposal is appropriate for publication in the RFC series and for
deployment in the Internet.</t>

<t>This document updates the similarly titled <xref target="RFC5033"/> that was
published in 2007 as a Best Current Practice to evaluate new
congestion control algorithms as Experimental or Proposed Standard RFCs.</t>

<t>In 2007, TCP was the dominant consumer of this work, and proposals were
typically discussed in research groups, for example the
Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG).</t>

<t>Since RFC 5033 was published, many conditions have changed.
The set of protocols using these algorithms has spread beyond
TCP and SCTP to include DCCP, QUIC, and beyond.
Some congestion control algorithm proponents now have the opportunity
to test and deploy at scale without IETF review.
There is more interest in specialized use cases such as data centers and
real-time protocols.
Finally, the community has gained much more experience with indications
of congestion beyond packet loss.</t>

<t>Multiple congestion control algorithms
have been developed outside of the IETF, including at least two that saw
large scale deployment: Cubic <xref target="HRX08"/> and BBR <xref target="BBR-draft"/>.</t>

<t>Cubic was documented in a research publication in 2007 <xref target="HRX08"/>,
and then adopted as the default congestion control algorithm for
the TCP implementation in Linux. It was already used in a significant
fraction of TCP connections over the Internet before being documented
in an informational Internet Draft in 2015, being published as an
informational RFC in 2017 <xref target="RFC8312"/> and then as a proposed
standard in 2023 <xref target="RFC9438"/>.</t>

<t>BBR is developed as an internal research project by Google,
with the first implementation contributed to Linux kernel 4.19 in 2016.
It was described in an IRTF draft in 2018, and that draft is
regularly updated to document the evolving versions of the algorithm
<xref target="BBR-draft"/>. BBR is widely used for Google services using either
TCP or QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/>, and is also largely deployed outside of
Google.</t>

<t>We cannot say now whether the original authors of <xref target="RFC5033"/>
expected that developers would be somehow waiting for IETF review
before widely deploying a congestion control algorithm over the
Internet, but the examples of Cubic and BBR teaches us that
deployment of new algorithms is not in fact gated by publication
of the algorithm as an RFC. Nevertheless, guidelines are
important, if only to remind potential inventors and developers of
the multiple facets of the congestion control problem.</t>

<t>The guidelines in this document are intended to be consistent with
the congestion control principles from <xref target="RFC2914"/> of preventing
congestion collapse, considering fairness, and optimizing the flow's
own performance in terms of throughput, delay, and loss.
<xref target="RFC2914"/>
also discusses the goal of avoiding a congestion control "arms race"
among competing transport protocols.</t>

<t>This document does not give hard-and-fast requirements for an
appropriate congestion control scheme.
Rather, the document provides
a set of criteria that should be considered and weighed by the
developers of congestion control algorithms and by the IETF
in the context of each proposal.
The high-order criteria for any new
proposal is that a serious scientific study of the pros and cons of
the proposal needs to have been done before a proposal is
considered for publication by the IETF or before it is deployed at
large scale.</t>

<t>After initial studies, we encourage authors to write a specification
of their proposals for publication in the RFC series to allow others
to concretely understand and investigate the wealth of proposals in
this space.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="document-status"><name>Document Status</name>

<t>Following the lead of HighSpeed TCP <xref target="RFC3649"/>, alternate congestion
control algorithms are expected to be published as "Experimental"
RFCs until such time that the community better understands the
solution space.
Traditionally, the meaning of "Experimental" status
has varied in its use and interpretation.
As part of this document
we define two classes of congestion control proposals that can be
published with the "Experimental" status.
The first class includes
algorithms that are judged to be safe to deploy for best-effort
traffic in the global Internet and further investigated in that
environment.
The second class includes algorithms that, while
promising, are not deemed safe enough for widespread deployment as
best-effort traffic on the Internet, but are being specified to
facilitate investigations in simulation, testbeds, or controlled
environments.
The second class can also include algorithms where the
IETF does not yet have sufficient understanding to decide if the
algorithm is or is not safe for deployment on the Internet.</t>

<t>Each alternate congestion control algorithm published is required to
include a statement in the abstract indicating whether or not the
proposal is considered safe for use on the Internet.
Each alternate
congestion control algorithm published is also required to include a
statement in the abstract describing environments where the protocol
is not recommended for deployment.
There may be environments where
the protocol is deemed <em>safe</em> for use, but still is not <em>recommended</em>
for use because it does not perform well for the user.</t>

<t>As examples of such statements, <xref target="RFC3649"/> specifying HighSpeed TCP
includes a statement in the abstract stating that the proposal is
Experimental, but may be deployed in the current Internet.  In
contrast, the Quick-Start document <xref target="RFC4782"/> includes a paragraph in
the abstract stating the mechanism is only being proposed for
controlled environments.  The abstract specifies environments where
the Quick-Start request could give false positives (and therefore
would be unsafe for incremental deployment where some routers
forward, but do not process the option).  The abstract also specifies environments
where packets containing the Quick-Start request could be dropped in
the network; in such an environment, Quick-Start would not be unsafe
to deploy, but deployment would not be recommended because it
could lead to unnecessary delays for the connections attempting to use
Quick-Start. The Quick-Start method is discussed as an example in <xref target="RFC9049"/>.</t>

<t>For authors of alternate congestion control schemes who are not ready
to bring their congestion control mechanisms to the IETF for
standardization (either as Experimental or as Proposed Standard), one
possibility would be to submit an internet-draft that documents the
alternate congestion control mechanism for the benefit of the IETF
and IRTF communities.  This is particularly encouraged in order to
ensure algorithm specifications are widely disseminated to facilitate
further research.  Such an internet-draft could also be
considered as an Informational RFC, as a first step in the process
towards standardization.  Such a document would be expected to
carry an explicit warning against using the scheme in the global
Internet.</t>

<t>Note: we are not changing the RFC publication process for non-IETF
produced documents (e.g., those from the IRTF or Independent
Submissions via the RFC-Editor).  However, we would hope the
guidelines in this document inform the IESG as they consider whether
to add a note to such documents.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="evaluation-criteria"><name>Evaluation Criteria</name>

<t>As noted above, authors are expected to do a well-rounded evaluation
of the pros and cons of proposals brought to the IETF.  The following
are guidelines to help authors and the IETF community.  Concerns that
fall outside the scope of these guidelines are certainly possible;
these guidelines should not be considered as an all-encompassing
check-list.</t>

<t>When considering a new congestion control proposal, the community MUST
consider the following criteria. These criteria will be evaluated in various
domains (see <xref target="general-use"/> and <xref target="special-cases"/>).</t>

<section anchor="single-algorithm-behavior"><name>Single Algorithm Behavior</name>

<t>The following criteria evaluate the proposed algorithm when one or more
flows using that algorithm share a bottleneck link, with no other algorithms
operating.</t>

<section anchor="protection-against-congestion-collapse"><name>Protection Against Congestion Collapse</name>

<t>The alternate congestion control mechanism should either stop
sending when the packet drop rate exceeds some threshold
<xref target="RFC3714"/>, or should include some notion of "full backoff".  For
"full backoff", at some point the algorithm would reduce the
sending rate to one packet per round-trip time and then
exponentially backoff the time between single packet
transmissions if congestion persists.  Exactly when either "full
backoff" or a pause in sending comes into play will be
algorithm-specific.  However, as discussed in <xref target="RFC2914"/>, this
requirement is crucial to protect the network in times of extreme
congestion.</t>

<t>If the result of full backoff is used, this test does not require that the
full backoff mechanism must be identical to that of TCP
<xref target="RFC2988"/>.  As an example, this bullet does not preclude full
backoff mechanisms that would give flows with different round-
trip times comparable capacity during backoff.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="protection-against-bufferbloat"><name>Protection Against Bufferbloat</name>

<t>The alternate congestion control mechanism should reduce its sending
rate if the round trip time (RTT) significantly increases. Exactly how
the algorithm reduces its sending rate is algorithm specific, but see
<xref target="RFC8961"/> and <xref target="RFC8085"/> for requirements.</t>

<t>Bufferbloat <xref target="Bufferbloat"/> refers to the building of long queues in
the network. Many network routers are configured with very large buffers.
If congestion starts happening, classic TCP congestion control algorithms
<xref target="RFC5681"/> will continue sending at a high rate until the buffer fills
up completely and packet losses occur. Every connection going through
that bottleneck will experience high latency.  This adds unwanted latency that
impacts highly interactive applications like games, but it also affects routine
web browsing and video playing.</t>

<t>This problem became apparent in the last decade and was not discussed in
the Congestion Control Principles published in September 2002 <xref target="RFC2914"/>.
The classic congestion control algorithm <xref target="RFC5681"/> and the widely deployed
Cubic algorithm <xref target="RFC9438"/> do not address it, but newly designed congestion
control algorithms have the opportunity to improve the state of the art.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="fairness-within-the-alternate-congestion-control-algorithm"><name>Fairness within the Alternate Congestion Control Algorithm.</name>

<t>When multiple competing flows all using the same
alternate congestion control algorithm, the proposal should
explore how the capacity is shared among the competing flows.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="short-flows"><name>Short Flows</name>

<t>(TODO: Discuss short and long flows)</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="mixed-algorithm-behavior"><name>Mixed Algorithm Behavior</name>

<t>These criteria evaluate the interaction of the proposal with commonly deployed
congestion controls.</t>

<section anchor="existing-general-purpose-transports"><name>Existing General-Purpose Transports</name>

<t>Evaluate the impact on TCP <xref target="RFC9293"/>, SCTP <xref target="RFC9260"/>, DCCP <xref target="RFC4340"/>,
and QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/>.</t>

<t>Proposed congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated when
competing with standard IETF congestion control <xref target="RFC5681"/>,
<xref target="RFC9260"/>, <xref target="RFC4340"/>, <xref target="RFC9002"/>, <xref target="RFC9438"/>.  Alternate
congestion controllers that have a significantly negative impact on
traffic using standard congestion control may be suspect and this aspect should
be part of the community's decision making with regards to the suitability of
the alternate congestion control mechanism. The community should also consider
other non-standard congestion controls known to be widely deployed,</t>

<t>We note that this bullet is not a requirement for strict Reno- or Cubic-
friendliness as a prerequisite for an alternate congestion
control mechanism to advance to Experimental.  As an example,
HighSpeed TCP is a congestion control mechanism that is
Experimental, but that is not TCP-friendly in all environments.
When a new algorithm is deployed, the existing major deployments need to be
considered to avoid severe performance degradation.
We also note that this guideline does not constrain the interaction with
non-best-effort traffic.</t>

<t>As an example from an Experimental RFC, fairness with standard TCP is discussed
in Sections 4 and 6 of <xref target="RFC3649"/> (HighSpeed TCP) and using spare capacity is
discussed in Sections 6, 11.1, and 12 of <xref target="RFC3649"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="real-time-protocols"><name>Real-Time Protocols</name>

<t>(TODO: Clarify that real time congestion controls are included, with
allowances for the poor documentation / open source availability of these)</t>

</section>
<section anchor="short-and-long-flows"><name>Short and Long Flows</name>

<t>(TODO: Discuss short and long flows)</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="other-criteria"><name>Other Criteria</name>

<section anchor="differences-with-congestion-control-principles"><name>Differences with Congestion Control Principles</name>

<t>Proposed congestion control mechanisms SHOULD include a clear
explanation of the deviations from <xref target="RFC2914"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="incremental-deployment"><name>Incremental Deployment.</name>

<t>The proposal should discuss whether the alternate congestion
control mechanism allows for incremental deployment in the
targeted environment.  For a mechanism targeted for deployment in
the current Internet, it would be helpful for the proposal to
discuss what is known (if anything) about the correct operation
of the mechanism with some of the equipment installed in the
current Internet, e.g., routers, transparent proxies, WAN
optimizers, intrusion detection systems, home routers, and the
like.</t>

<t>As a similar concern, if the alternate congestion control
mechanism is intended only for specific environments (and not the
global Internet), the proposal should consider how this intention
is to be carried out.  The community will have to address the
question of whether the scope can be enforced by simply stating
the restrictions or whether additional protocol mechanisms are
required to enforce the scoping.  The answer will necessarily
depend on the change being proposed.</t>

<t>As an example from an Experimental RFC, deployment issues are
discussed in Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of <xref target="RFC4782"/> (Quick-Start).</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="general-use"><name>General Use</name>

<t>The criteria in <xref target="evaluation-criteria"/> will be evaluated in the
following scenarios. Unless a proposal is explicitly forbidden on the
public internet, the community MUST find that it meets the criteria
in these scenarios for the proposal to progress.</t>

<t>The evaluation in each scenario should occur over a representative range of
bandwidths, delays, and queue depths. Of course, the set of parameters
representative of the public internet will change over time.</t>

<t>These criteria are meant to capture a statistically dominant set of internet
conditions. In the case that the algorithm has been tested at internet scale,
the results from that deployment are often useful for answering these questions.</t>

<section anchor="wired-networks"><name>Wired Networks</name>

<t>(TODO: Describe properties of wired networks.)</t>

<t>Proposals should be investigated for robust performance with different
queueing mechanisms in the routers,
especially Random Early Detection (RED) <xref target="FJ03"/> and Drop-Tail.
This evaluation is often not included in the internet-draft
itself, but in related papers cited in the draft.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="wireless-networks"><name>Wireless networks</name>

<t>While the early Internet was dominated by wired links, the properties
of wireless links have become extremely important to Internet performance.
In particular, congestion controllers should be evaluated in situations
where some packet losses are due to radio effects, rather than router
queue drops; the link capacity varies over time due to changing link conditions;
and media access delays and link-layer retransmission lead to increased jitter
in round-trip times. See <xref target="RFC3819"/> and Section 16 of <xref target="Tools"/> for further
discussion of wireless properties.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="special-cases"><name>Special Cases</name>

<t>The criteria in <xref target="evaluation-criteria"/> will be evaluated in the
following scenarios, unless the proposal specifically excludes its use in a
scenario. The community MAY allow a proposal to progress even if the criteria
indicate an unsatisfactory result for these scenarios.</t>

<t>In general, measurements from internet-scale deployments will not expose the
properties of operation in these scenarios, as they are statistically small.</t>

<section anchor="internet-of-things"><name>Internet of Things</name>

<t>(TODO: Write this section)</t>

</section>
<section anchor="satellite"><name>Satellite</name>

<t>Satellite links often have delays longer than typical for wired paths
<xref target="RFC2488"/> and high delay bandwidth products <xref target="RFC3649"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="misbehaving-nodes"><name>Misbehaving Nodes</name>

<t>The proposal should explore how the alternate congestion control
mechanism performs with non-compliant senders, receivers, or
routers.  In addition, the proposal should explore how the
alternate congestion control mechanism performs with outside
attackers.  This can be particularly important for congestion
control mechanisms that involve explicit feedback from routers
along the path.</t>

<t>As an example from an Experimental RFC, performance with
misbehaving nodes and outside attackers is discussed in Sections
9.4, 9.5, and 9.6 of <xref target="RFC4782"/> (Quick-Start).  This includes
discussion of misbehaving senders and receivers; collusion
between misbehaving routers; misbehaving middleboxes; and the
potential use of Quick-Start to attack routers or to tie up
available Quick-Start bandwidth.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="tunnel-behavior"><name>Tunnel Behavior</name>

<t>When the proposal relies on explicit signals from the path, the effect of
traffic passing through the tunnel -- where routers may not be aware of the
underlying flow -- MUST be considered.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="extreme-packet-reordering"><name>Extreme Packet Reordering</name>

<t><xref target="RFC4653"/> discusses the effect of extreme packet reordering.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="transient-events"><name>Transient Events</name>

<t>The proposal should consider how the alternate congestion control
mechanism would perform in the presence of transient events such
as sudden congestion, a routing change, or a mobility event.
Routing changes, link disconnections, intermittent link
connectivity, and mobility are discussed in more detail in
Section 17 of <xref target="Tools"/>.</t>

<t>As an example from an Experimental RFC, response to transient
events is discussed in Section 9.2 of <xref target="RFC4782"/> (Quick-Start).</t>

<section anchor="sudden-changes-in-path"><name>Sudden changes in Path</name>

<t>An IETF transport is not tied to a specific Internet path.
The set of routers forming a path can and do change with time,
this will also cause the properties of the path to change with respect to time.
New CCs MUST evaluate the impact of changes in the path, and be robust
to changes in path characteristics on the interval of common Internet re-routing intervals.</t>

<t>Event when the routers constituting a path does not change, the properties of
that path can vary, with similar impacts on congestion control</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="multipath"><name>Multipath</name>

<t>Multipath transport protocols permit more than one path to be differentiated and used by
a single connection at the sender.
A multipath sender can schedule which packets travel on which of its active paths.
This enables a tradeoff in timeliness and reliability.</t>

<t>One use is to provide fail-over from one path to
another when the original path is no longer viable or to switch the traffic from
one path to another when this is expected to improve performance
(latency, throughput, reliability, cost).
Designs need to independently track the congestion state of each path,
and need to demonstrate independent congestion control for each path being used.
New multipath CCs that implement path fail-over MUST evaluate the harm resulting
from a change in the path, and show that this does not result in flow starvation.
Synchronisation of failover (e.g., where multiple flows change their path on similar
timeframes) can also contribute to harm and/or reduce fairness,
these effects also ought to be evaluated.</t>

<t>A concurrent multipath transport protocol simultaneously
schedules flows to aggregate the capacity across multiple paths.
The Internet provides no guarantee that different paths
(e.g., using different endpoint addresses) are disjoint.
This has additional implications:
New CCs MUST evaluate the potential
harm to other flows when the multiple paths share a common
congested bottleneck
(or share resources that are coupled between different paths,
such as an overall capacity limit), and SHOULD consider
the fairness with other flows. Synchronisation of CC mechanisms
(e.g., where multiple flows change their behaviour on similar
timeframes) can also contribute to harm and/or reduce fairness,
these effects also ought to be evaluated.
At the time of writing, there are no IETF standards for concurrent
multipath congestion control in the general Internet.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>This document does not represent a change to any aspect of the TCP/IP
protocol suite and therefore does not directly impact Internet
security.  The implementation of various facets of the Internet's
current congestion control algorithms do have security implications
(e.g., as outlined in <xref target="RFC5681"/>).  Alternate congestion control
schemes should be mindful of such pitfalls, as well, and should
examine any potential security issues that may arise.</t>

      <t>Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of congestion along a network path).

    <abstract>
      <t>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provides a minimal message-passing transport that has no inherent congestion control mechanisms. This document provides guidelines on the use of UDP for the designers of applications, tunnels, and other protocols that use UDP. Congestion control guidelines are a primary focus, but the document also provides guidance on other topics, including message sizes, reliability, checksums, middlebox traversal, the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs), and ports.</t>
      <t>Because congestion control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet, applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as an Internet transport must employ mechanisms to prevent congestion collapse and to establish some degree of fairness with concurrent traffic. They may also need to implement additional mechanisms, depending on how they use UDP.</t>
      <t>Some guidance is also applicable to the design of other protocols (e.g., protocols layered directly on IP or via IP-based tunnels), especially when these protocols do not themselves provide congestion control.</t>
      <t>This document obsoletes RFC 5405 and adds guidelines for multicast UDP usage.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793. It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements. It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state. The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.</t>

	 <t>   This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm.  BBR
   (&quot;Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time&quot;) uses recent
   measurements of a transport connection&#x27;s delivery rate, round-trip
   time, and packet loss rate to build an explicit model of the network
   path.  BBR then uses this model to control both how fast it sends
   data and the maximum volume of data it allows in flight in the
   network at any time.  Relative to loss-based congestion control
   algorithms such as Reno [RFC5681] or CUBIC [RFC8312], BBR offers
   substantially higher throughput for bottlenecks with shallow buffers
   or random losses, and substantially lower queueing delays for
   bottlenecks with deep buffers (avoiding &quot;bufferbloat&quot;).  BBR can be
   implemented in any transport protocol that supports packet-delivery
   acknowledgment.  Thus far, open source implementations are available
   for TCP [RFC793] and QUIC [RFC9000].  This document specifies version
   2 of the BBR algorithm, also sometimes referred to as BBRv2 or bbr2.

      <t>CUBIC is an extension to the current TCP standards. It differs from the current TCP standards only in the congestion control algorithm on the sender side. In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of a linear window increase function of the current TCP standards to improve scalability and stability under fast and long-distance networks. CUBIC and its predecessor algorithm have been adopted as defaults by Linux and have been used for many years. This document provides a specification of CUBIC to enable third-party implementations and to solicit community feedback through experimentation on the performance of CUBIC.</t>

    <title>HighSpeed TCP for Large Congestion Windows</title>
    <author fullname="S. Floyd" initials="S." surname="Floyd"/>
    <date month="December" year="2003"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>The proposals in this document are experimental. While they may be deployed in the current Internet, they do not represent a consensus that this is the best method for high-speed congestion control. In particular, we note that alternative experimental proposals are likely to be forthcoming, and it is not well understood how the proposals in this document will interact with such alternative proposals. This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments. For example, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets (or equivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours). This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint. To address his limitation of TCP, this document proposes HighSpeed TCP, and solicits experimentation and feedback from the wider community.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an optional Quick-Start mechanism for transport protocols, in cooperation with routers, to determine an allowed sending rate at the start and, at times, in the middle of a data transfer (e.g., after an idle period). While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path approve the Quick-Start Request.</t>
      <t>This document describes many paths where Quick-Start Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers, IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments where the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.

      <t>This document discusses IAB concerns about effective end-to-end congestion control for best-effort voice traffic in the Internet. These concerns have to do with fairness, user quality, and with the dangers of congestion collapse. The concerns are particularly relevant in light of the absence of a widespread Quality of Service (QoS) deployment in the Internet, and the likelihood that this situation will not change much in the near term. This document is not making any recommendations about deployment paths for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in terms of QoS support, and is not claiming that best-effort service can be relied upon to give acceptable performance for VoIP. We are merely observing that voice traffic is occasionally deployed as best-effort traffic over some links in the Internet, that we expect this occasional deployment to continue, and that we have concerns about the lack of effective end-to-end congestion control for this best-effort voice traffic.

      <t>This document specifies Non-Congestion Robustness (NCR) for TCP. In the absence of explicit congestion notification from the network, TCP uses loss as an indication of congestion. One of the ways TCP detects loss is using the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments. However, this heuristic is not always correct, notably in the case when network paths reorder segments (for whatever reason), resulting in degraded performance. TCP-NCR is designed to mitigate this degraded performance by increasing the number of duplicate acknowledgments required to trigger loss recovery, based on the current state of the connection, in an effort to better disambiguate true segment loss from segment reordering. This document specifies the changes to TCP, as well as the costs and benefits of these modifications. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the metrics to be considered in an evaluation of new or modified congestion control mechanisms for the Internet. These include metrics for the evaluation of new transport protocols, of proposed modifications to TCP, of application-level congestion control, and of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms in the router. This document is the first in a series of documents aimed at improving the models that we use in the evaluation of transport protocols.</t>
      <t>This document is a product of the Transport Modeling Research Group (TMRG), and has received detailed feedback from many members of the Research Group (RG). As the document tries to make clear, there is not necessarily a consensus within the research community (or the IETF community, the vendor community, the operations community, or any other community) about the metrics that congestion control mechanisms should be designed to optimize, in terms of trade-offs between throughput and delay, fairness between competing flows, and the like. However, we believe that there is a clear consensus that congestion control mechanisms should be evaluated in terms of trade-offs between a range of metrics, rather than in terms of optimizing for a single metric.
